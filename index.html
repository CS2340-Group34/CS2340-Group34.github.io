<h2> Introduction: </h2>
<p> The semester-long project for CS 2340 was focused on promoting sustainable and healthy eating by implementing an application that was able to do so. Working in a team, the goal was to implement features that allow the user to control food management, store recipes, and track food consumption. We used Android Studio as the main coding program, and firebase to store databases that were required for the program's functionality. The appâ€™s functionality plays a really significant role in promoting healthy eating and food shopping habits through user input, visualizations, and functionalities including, tracking calorie intake, creating recipes based on items in the pantry, and purchasing food items from the grocery store. </p>
