<h1 style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"> Conclusion </h1>

<p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"> To conclude this project, it is safe to say we had a very hard working and efficient group that managed to successfully follow and go beyond the guidelines for this assignment and complete it at a high level. We had a very good team dynamic and worked really well as a team and we never had any arguments or conflicts between one another. Our time management was good, although we did have to work on our code a lot last minute but due to our planned out tasks before starting the implementation we knew what each of our focuses were so it made it much more organized when working. Definitely an area of improvement can be completing the code slightly more ahead of time so that we aren’t cramming everything the night of the deadline. As a team we didn’t encounter any issues or any conflict as to what each person needs to do when working on the implementation and design deliverables. Each person put an equal amount of effort in and we never had anyone not participating or helping in the work that we assigned one another. There were some deviations to what we had initially planned in our pre-sprint agreements, as some tasks were a little harder than others, so we had 2 people working on one harder implementation, and one person working on multiple smaller implementations and this made our work much more coherent and time efficient. Pair-programming is a skill that we found super helpful for us because we were able to spot mistakes easily, help others out, and work at a faster pace. During each sprint we had some small problems with the firebase, however, as we went through each sprint we got more knowledgeable with how it worked and how we can solve these problems without the TA’s aid. Throughout the four sprints, our team developed a very strong work bond and we learned the way each of us work, our habits and routine which made the teamwork much easier. We kept improving as a group when it came to collaboration and communication, as well as the improvement of our skills. Some of us came into this class with more knowledge and expertise in Java, specifically the front-end developing aspect of it, however, some of us didn’t but have definitely significantly improved our skills and understand it much better. </p>
